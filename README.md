# RoleBot

## Usage 
Create a bot token and make sure the bot has manage messages.
The role and emoji that you react with must be named the same.
Create your message and then copy the message id and put it where my message id is.


## Example
SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into "smart" typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

|                |Role                          |Emoji                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'DiRTthis fun            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
